The files included in this repository are the result of months of work on my bachelor thesis. The title of my thesis is XXX and can be found within the files in this repository. Even though there is an already existing computer simulation of SURE_REACH made in Java I have decided to create an independent version solely based on the academic paper and its model description. The model is an interesting attempt at describing the way humans move and coordinate their movements on an example of a single planar 3-DOF arm.
